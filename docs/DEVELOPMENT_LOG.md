## 2026-10-01 — Phase 0 and original Ladybug radiation smoke

- DONE: Read actual environment; bounded explicit-slot Rhino MCP; runtime/plugin/component/solver/asset audits; stock radiation definition; Rhino-origin input snapshot, colored mesh, legend, 3dm fixture and viewport image.
- FILES CHANGED: New EnvironmentalSimulationHub directory only; existing projects unchanged.
- GH CHANGED: Added one new radiation_main.gh using three installed original Ladybug 1.10.0 user objects. New groups and fixture inputs; no existing user definition edited.
- TEST RESULT: RUNTIME VERIFIED. 16 finite radiation values, 16 mesh faces, 64 vertex colors, 3 legend items, no component error/warning, repeat max absolute difference 0. Viewport image inspected. Three persisted-evidence tests passed; filesystem scan returned 0 with no access errors after excluding temporary QA directories.
- ROOT CAUSE/FIX: Sandbox-only router SQLite write failed; authorized router execution worked. Default slot was stale; explicitly selected aardvark. New GH document was disabled; enabled the same document before solving. Incorrect LB Sky Matrix name was corrected to the live-discovered LB Cumulative Sky Matrix.
- KNOWN ISSUES: Seattle smoke weather only; native original-component repeatability is not independent scientific validation. No production request/result adapter, preflight, panel, reset or wind execution. Binary existing workflows remain UNKNOWN. OpenFOAM UNVERIFIED. Persisted fixture input is a snapshot rather than a live selection binding.
- GIT: Parent repository initially had no commits or configured human identity. Milestone uses a command-local Codex author identity and stages only the Hub folder; global Git settings remain unchanged. Commit completion must be verified separately.
- NEXT: Implement explicit radiation contracts and adapter/preflight, then perform stock-workflow numerical comparison before Eto UI.
